Do you hear the call from a hundred lands.<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lords of a dying name?</span><br />
We are the men of sinewed hands<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whom the earth and the seas acclaim.</span><br />
We are the hoards that made you lords.<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And gathered your gear and spoil.</span><br />
And we speak with a word that should be heard&mdash;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hark to the tongues of toil!</span><br />
<br />
The power of your hands it falls at last,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The strength of your rule is o'er,</span><br />
Where the might of a million slaves is massed<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To the shouts of a million more.</span><br />
We rise, we rise, 'neath the western skies,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And the dawns of the east afar;</span><br />
And our myriads swarm in the southlands warm,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And under the northern star!</span><br />
<br />
We take no thought of the fears you feel,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And the rage you hold at heart,</span><br />
Nor of all your strength of the gold and steel<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Enthroned at the gates of mart.</span><br />
We have no care for the deeds you dare,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For the force of your armies hurled;</span><br />
You stand but few, and we challenge you&mdash;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Strong men of all the world!</span><br />
<br />
We served as your fools when time was young,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And long, long we forbore.</span><br />
Glad of the niggard boons you flung,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The least of your ample store;</span><br />
But the gnawing pain of a starving brain<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Is great as the belly need&mdash;</span><br />
We have learned at last from a hungry past<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The joys of a rebel deed!</span><br />
<br />
We come, we come, with the force of fate;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>We are not weak, but strong.</span><br />
We parley not, and we cannot wait;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>We march with a freeman's song.</span><br />
We claim for meed what a life we can need<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That lives as a life should live&mdash;</span><br />
Not less, not more, From the plenteous store<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which freeborn labors give!</span><br />
<br />
We shall shape a world as a world should be,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With room enough for all.</span><br />
We will rear a race of the wise and free,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And not of the great and small.</span><br />
And the heart and the mind of humankind<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shall drink to the dregs of good,</span><br />
Forgetting the tears of the darker years,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And the curse of bondman's blood.</span><br />
<br />
In vain you soften the voice of greed,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In vain you speak us fair;</span><br />
The time is late, and we hark nor heed;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In gladness still we dare.</span><br />
Yield, then, yield to the force we wield,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To the masses of our might;</span><br />
We are countless strong at the throat of wrong<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The warriors of the right!</span><br />
<br />
Yes, we are the captains of the earth<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And the warders of the sea&mdash;</span><br />
Of a race new born in nobler birth,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The mighty and the free!</span><br />
We clasp all hands, to the farthest lands;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>We swear by our mother soil,</span><br />
To take the meed who have done the deed!<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hark to the tongues of toil!</span><br />

The hangman's hands are dyed with blood,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And all they touch or hold</span><br />
Is stained and streaked with clotted blood<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>E'en to his bloody gold&mdash;</span><br />
The coins that are paid for human breath<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And the lives which he has sold.</span><br />
<br />
In scarlet hue stand old and new&mdash;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His clothes, his board, his bed.</span><br />
There is blood in the cup he lifts up,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And crimson in his bread;</span><br />
And e'en his floors and walls and doors<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Are marked with gory red.</span><br />
<br />
The hangman's face is dull and grey,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And soulless are his eyes;</span><br />
That he may live from day to day,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Some fellow-being dies.</span><br />
The tears of the young are naught to him,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nor ages stifled cries.</span><br />
<br />
He does not know the sob of woe;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Black fear he does not know;</span><br />
Hardly a word from his lips are heard,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And his ears heed no appeal.</span><br />
His cruel chin reveals within<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A nature hard as steel,</span><br />
The hangman's thoughts are not of love,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nor are they yet of hate;</span><br />
They do not lift themselves above<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The dungeon's iron gate;</span><br />
Their interests are the knotted rope<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And the heavy gallows weight.</span><br />
<br />
His mind is filled with the counted killed<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And the hope of more to come.</span><br />
And the price they fling when men must swing,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which makes a goodly sum;</span><br />
For his reason waits on the law's black hates,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, save for this, stands dumb.</span><br />
<br />
The hangman's soul lies stiff and stark.<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The hangman's heart is dead;</span><br />
And the need of friends is a burnt out spark<br />
For he is marked with the murder's mark.<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And with blood upon his head.</span><br />
<br />
In times of rest he knows no guest&mdash;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No hand will touch him, none!</span><br />
Nor woman mild nor happy child<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Greets him when day is done;</span><br />
And he walks the night, a poison blight,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>An outcast of the sun</span><br />

Oh, what are these that plod the road<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>At dawn's first hour and evening's chime,</span><br />
Each back bent as beneath a load;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Each sallow face afoul with grime?</span><br />
Nay, what are these whose little feet<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Scarce bear theme on to toil or bed!</span><br />
Do hearts within their bosoms beat?<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Surely, 'twere better that they were dead.</span><br />
<br />
Babes are they, domed to cruel dooms.<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Who labor all the livelong day;</span><br />
Who stand beside the roaring looms<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Nor ever turn their eyes away;</span><br />
Like parts of those machines of steel:<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Like wheels that whirl, like shuttles thrown;</span><br />
Without the power to dream or feel;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>With all of childishness.</span><br />
<br />
Brothers and sisters of the flowers,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Fit playmates of the bird and bee.</span><br />
For you grow soft the springtime hours;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>For you the shade lies neath the tree.</span><br />
For you life smiles the whole day long;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>For you she breathes each breath in bliss,</span><br />
And turns all sound into song;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And you, and you have come to this!</span><br />
<br />
Is't not enough that man should toil<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>To fill the hands that clutch for gold?</span><br />
Is't not enough that women toil.<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And in life's summertime grow old?</span><br />
Is't not enough that death should pale<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>To see men welcome him as rest;</span><br />
But must the children drudge and fall,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And perish on the mothers breast?</span><br />
<br />
See, lovers, wed at tender eve;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>See, mothers, with your new-born young;</span><br />
See, fathers&mdash;if you can, believe;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>From infant blood, lo, wealth is wrung!</span><br />
See homes; see towns; see cities; states;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Earth, show it to the skies above!</span><br />
Lovers who pass through rapture's gates,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Are these, are these your fruits of love?</span><br />
<br />
O man who boast your lands subdued,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Your conquered air, your oceans tamed,</span><br />
Who mold all nature to your mood,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Look on these babes and be ashamed!</span><br />
Dull looks from out each weary face,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Cold words upon each little tongue&mdash;</span><br />
Dead lives that know not childhoods grace,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Grown old before they can be young.</span><br />
<br />
Hear, world of Mammon, brutal, bold,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Goring with life the maw of greed,</span><br />
Measuring everything by gold;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>The good deed with the evil deed&mdash;</span><br />
The pangs of suffering childhoods care,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Now coined in coins to fill a purse,</span><br />
These things shall haunt you everywhere,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And rest upon you for a curse!</span><br />

The world was made with labor:<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Strong fusing air and fire</span><br />
Strove before the years of birth,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With awful deed and dire,</span><br />
And wrought from primal chaos<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Amidst the ancient night.</span><br />
The seas and shores which are the earth,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And shapes of morning light.</span><br />
<br />
Yea, bound in frenzied orbits,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The solar substance sped</span><br />
With travail of the moon and stars,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And planets live and dead;</span><br />
And wombed and birthed in anguish,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As heirs of all its toil,</span><br />
Earth's vale and hill and ribs of rock,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And the rivers in her soil.</span><br />
<br />
Life was formed by labor:<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From out of the bubbling ooze.</span><br />
By cosmic ferment molded well,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And tropic suns and dews,</span><br />
With stress of chemic struggle<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Were built with warding care</span><br />
The potent powers of earth and sea,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And the wings of all the air.</span><br />
Yea, through the mystic process<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of crystallizing form,</span><br />
To green growths sprung across the land,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And bloods of cold and warm,</span><br />
The vital stream of being<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In flooding efforts swirled,</span><br />
And beast and bird and swimming fish <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Made animate the world. </span><br />
<br />
Man was wrought by labor: <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fierce things of growth and might,</span><br />
Where waring species hold their sway,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Keen eared and clear of sight.</span><br />
Toiled in craft and cunning<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And strength of ripening brain,</span><br />
Till rose the form that grasped the world <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And made it his domain.</span><br />
<br />
Yea, with red feud and ravage <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of saber tooth and claw.</span><br />
With banding of the pack for might<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And filled or starving maw;</span><br />
From floundering saurians welter,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Through grin and screech of ape,</span><br />
Struggled the deathless seed of life<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Up to human shape.</span><br />
<br />
And man hath made with labor:<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From his wild primal hour,</span><br />
Potent with transforming deeds.<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He hath wed will to power;</span><br />
Through war and peace untiring,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To industry and art,</span><br />
Spending the might of all his thought<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And the hope of all his heart.</span><br />
<br />
Yea, tried in stress of effort<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And passions wise and vain,</span><br />
His zeal hath gathered wisdoms seed <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From fruits of joy and pain. </span><br />
His millioned cities echo; <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His ships have pathed the sea;</span><br />
And with bent brow he toils to make<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The world that yet will be.</span><br />

Are here no hapless, vacant arms, which <br />

And what are you, who at her gird, and deem <br />

Your lust of power, the debtors tears, cold <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>hunger's starving cries,</span><br />
And all the evil of your years, that clamors <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>to the skies!</span><br />
<br />
Your horror is a vail to wear and cover o'er <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>your deeds;</span><br />
Your wrongs are pointed at you there, though <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>none your presence heeds.</span><br />
Your vileness would itself deny in falsest hate <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>of hers;</span><br />
Gaze at yourself with inward eye, you whited <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>sepulchers!</span><br />
<br />
Repent! Your vanity betrays, and wrenches <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>reason strong,</span><br />
Until it wraps the truth to ways which shape <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>a right of wrong;</span><br />
But every sin is still a sin; and if your hands <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>be shriven,</span><br />
Her heart is no more black within, and she <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>shall be forgiven.</span><br />
<br />
You ask not where those siren lips learned <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>their unworthy skill,</span><br />
Nor reck of how shame's black eclipse obscured <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>her purer will.</span><br />
You think not whence fair thoughts like <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>flowers gave room to passions low;</span><br />
You know not of her girlhood's hours; you <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>do not care to know.</span><br />
<br />
Nay! But the truth cries for the light, and <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>struggles to be heard;</span><br />
The story of her bruise and blight shall out <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>in burning word&mdash;</span><br />
Yours was the power which crushed that <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>grace and gave it to despair,</span><br />
And the mask of beauty on that face, your <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>hands have painted there!</span><br />
<br />
She was the temple of your lust, the altar of <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>your greed;</span><br />
The sacrifice of faith and trust you made with <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>careful heed.</span><br />
She was the price of pleasure's worth, the <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>weight against your gold,</span><br />
Where love and truth repine in dearth, and all <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>is bought and sold.</span><br />
<br />
And will you loathe your work at last, and <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>spurn her with disgust?</span><br />
And shall your pride blot out the past and <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>hide her murdered trust?</span><br />
And will you brand upon her brow the deeds <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>which she doth do?</span><br />
Speak; Will you dare to hate her now, who <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>weeps, and pardons you?</span><br />
<br />
Nay, more scoff to see her sink, nor laugh <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>upon her tears;</span><br />
You shall not hand hate's baneful drink, and <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>mock her with your jeers.</span><br />
Bow down and hide your head for shame, and <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>for your acts atone,</span><br />
Accept your guilt; abide your blame; nor cast <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>a single stone.</span><br />
<br />
And crimson sin shall balance sin, and none <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>shall be denied,</span><br />
Till every heart is soft within and humbled <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>in its pride.</span><br />
And each with each shall equal stand, and all <br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>be one in worth,</span><br />
Till every hand shall clasp a hand and love <br />
<span style='margin-left: 1.5em;'>shall fill the earth.</span><br />

Banner of crimson waving there,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou shalt have full homage from me;</span><br />
First among flags thou gleamest fair,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Symbol of love and of life made free.</span><br />
The nations have chosen standards of state<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To flaunt to the winds since time began;</span><br />
Emblems of rivalry, pride and hate;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But thou are the flag of the world, of Man.</span><br />
<br />
Red as the blood of freedom's dead,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy hues might well have flowed from their veins.</span><br />
Red as the one blood of man is red,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Holy thou art in thy sanguine stains.</span><br />
Holy as truth and holy as right;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sacred as wisdom and sacred as love;</span><br />
Worthy the rapture that lifted to light<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy glorious shape where it ripples above.</span><br />
<br />
Unto the spirit of friendliness<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou was fashioned, to comfort man's hungry thought;</span><br />
To shine for the deeds that alone can bless,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And the life of brotherhood nobly wrought</span><br />
Unto the spirit that rends the gyves<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And shatters the bonds that make men slaves;</span><br />
The spirit that suffers and sinks and strives.<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Till it strengthens hope, till it lifts and saves.</span><br />
<br />
Thou art no new thing; thou hast waved from of old.<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou hast seen the day be born from the night;</span><br />
And hast streamed for truth where the truth was bold<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As time fled on to the future's light.</span><br />
Beyond all the seas, on many a shore,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou hast buttressed the heart and stiffened the hand</span><br />
To struggle for fellowship o're and o're,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>From the youth to the age of the eldest land.</span><br />
<br />
Thou hast called to battle! Yea, thou hast led<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where men have followed, forgetting fears</span><br />
And hast solaced the dying and graced the dead,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Stained with blood and with dust and tears</span><br />
&mdash;Blood, a full tribute paid for peace;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Tears shed free o're humanity's wrongs,</span><br />
With faith in thy cause, that could never cease,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Met tyranny's swords, and fell, singing thy songs.</span><br />
<br />
As thou art loved, thou art loathed, full well;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Loathed and cursed by the lords of power.</span><br />
Ever they name thee the flag of hell,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And rage in the fear of thy triumph hour.</span><br />
But their grasp grows week on the wills of men;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their armies falter; their guns are rust;</span><br />
As from prison, and labor of poverty's den<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy hosts speak NO to their crumbling lust.</span><br />
<br />
See! Now there greet the ten million eyes,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And lips uncounted smile to thy red.</span><br />
Yes, those who bow to thy crimson dyes,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Are myriads more than all of thy dead.</span><br />
Lo! The young clap hands at thy bright unrest;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And the child in arms it leaps in its glee.</span><br />
Nay, babes unborn, 'neath the mother's breast<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And given and pledged to thy cause and to thee!</span><br />
<br />
Banner of freedom and freedom's peace.<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Float in thy beauty, in sign of the day</span><br />
When ravage of power and conquest shall cease,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And mouldering tyranny pass away.</span><br />
Who would not all for thy promise give?<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As I gaze on the fools, one wish have I&mdash;</span><br />
To love thee and honor thee while I live,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And fold thee around me when I must die!</span><br />

No knotty theories<br />

<br />
The deep philosopher,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The pedant wise, whose wisdom makes him cold.</span><br />
Instructs, but cannot stir<br />

But this one strives to spur<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The rebel in the blood and make it bold.</span><br />
<br />
He lifts the common thought,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And e'en the common heart up to the light;</span><br />
Till, by his teaching wrought<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To understand their wrongs and know their might</span><br />
Plain men at last are brought<br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To rouse in truceless struggle for the right.</span><br />

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
